## Technology stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
Chatbot API: Anthropicâ€™s Claude API Sonnet-5
Storage: Local Storage
Timer: Custom JS Timer
Notifications: Custom In-app notifications
Deployment: Netlify
Backend: A simple python server for Anthropic integration

What succeeded?
	An aesthetic dashboard, a Calendar with possibility of adding and editing the events, a Chatbot which can handle a deep conversation and offer emotional support, as well as simplifying creations of to-do lists and events. With a minimum input adds tasks to the to-do list and events to the calendar. Shows notifications after completing tasks.
Has a Pomodoro timer with work/break time and built-in soothing sounds. 

What did not succeed? The tasks in the to-do list are created one by one, not altogether as initially planned. Cannot add events or tasks without a user pressing a button.
